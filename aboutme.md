For the past few years, I have been a Scientist with the [Institute of High-Performance Computing (IHPC)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc), a flagship interdisciplinary research entity of [Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/), a leading science, technology and research organisation in Singapore. 

At A\*STAR, I was part of the [Social and Cognitive Computing](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/social-cognitive-computing) Department and the [Social Sciences and Technology Horizontal Training Coordination Office](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/htco/sst). I lent my expertise in human behaviour and user research techniques to academic and industry projects, especially research on cross-cultural factors that influence human attitudes, perceptions and behaviours across various domains, such as online gaming, financial risk-taking, and physical and mental well-being. You can read about the kind of work I have done [here](nandinianant.com/projects/). 

I also co-supervised Masters and final-year Undergraduate students in their dissertations at James Cook University Singapore and Newcastle University (Singapore campus). 

Since September 2024, I am based in London, UK and exploring my next opportunity.
