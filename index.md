Hi there! I'm a London-based consultant and user behaviour researcher looking for my next role. 

I have over 7 years of global research and strategy experience in addressing complex and real-world issues using behavioural insights and causal inference approaches. I have worked with B2B and B2C partners in consumer goods, travel and transport, public sector, non-profit, healthcare and health-tech industries on a wide range of projects. I specialise in understanding user attitudes, predicting consumer behaviour and enhancing the user experience to help organisations create quantifiable value.

I am an experimental social psychologist by training, and I started my career as a user behaviour and consumer attitudes consultant and data analyst. As a result, I now think like a storyteller! 

I enjoy combining psychology and consumer theories with statistical analyses to craft compelling data-driven research narratives.

Think there's something we can chat about? Drop me an [email](mailto:nandini@nandinianant.com)!
