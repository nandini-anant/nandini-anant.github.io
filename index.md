Hi there! I am an experimental social psychologist nagivating the intersection of risk-taking behaviour, social support and well-being in both digital and physical environments. I am currently a Research Scientist with the [Institute of High-Performance Computing](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc), a flagship inter-discplinary research institute of [Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) Singapore. 

As part of the [Social and Cognitive Computing](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/social-cognitive-computing) Department and the [Social Sciences and Technology Horizontal Training Coordination Office](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/htco/sst), I lend my expertise in human behaviour and user research techniques to a range of [Projects](insert Projects hyperlink here). I also offer Final-Year Projects as a Supervisor for Masters and undergraduate students at James Cook University Singapore and Newcastle University (Singapore campus). 

My current research focuses are on cross-cultural factors that influence human attitudes, perceptions and behaviours across various domains, including online gamine, risk-taking behaviour and mental well-being. 

I have over 8 years of combined academic, industry and research consulting experience in addressing complex and real-world issues using behavioural insights and causal inference approaches. I work with industry partners in digital healthcare, electrification of vehicles and consumer insights. Through these research collaborations, I have generated actionable insights on user behavior and helped organizations create quantifiable value from their involvement.
