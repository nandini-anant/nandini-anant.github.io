# Ongoing Projects

## 1.  Child and parent perceptions of alternative proteins
As part of a Singapore Food Story Theme 3 grant awarded to my colleague [Dr. Aimee Pink](wwww.researchgate.net/profile/Aimee-Pink), we ran a qualitative study to assess parents and children's perceptions of alternative proteins in Singapore. I conducted focus groups with parents of children between 9 to 15 years of age with the aim of understanding how parents make food-related decisions for their children. The overall goal for this study was to engage children at a young age and parents as their primary decision maker for food chocies and empower them as advocates of alternative proteins. This study was [pregistered](https://osf.io/ag9n8/).   

We are in the process of coding and analysing data from both parent and child focus groups. Some of our preliminary findings have been presented at conferences like the [British Feeding and Drinking Group conference 2023](insert link to poster from Research Outputs page). 

## 2. Investigating the Influence of the Functional Mechanisms of Digital Health Intervention (DHI) for Dementia Prevention in the Singapore Context
This study is a mixed-methods approach into empirically investigating if and how functional mechanisms of digital health interventions can influence behaviour adoption intentions and health-related self-regulation behaviour among elderly at risk of dementia in Singapore. Through the development of the SENIOR app, we intend to identify indivuals at risk of developing dementia and offer behaviour and lifestyle recommendations to mitigate their risk. This study is part of a 2022 Social Sciences and Innovation Seed Fund Grant awarded to Dr. Jason Yue Yanzhen (PI)<sup>1</sup>, <strong>Dr. Nandini Anant</strong><sup>1</sup>, Myo Kyaw Sett<sup>2</sup> and Alok Kumar Verma<sup>2</sup>.

## 3. [Singapore Integrated Transport and Energy Model; SITEM](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-tech-hub/features/uss/integrated-citywide-model-of-vehicle-electrification)
SITEM is the first high-fidelity, island-wide simulation of electric vehicles in Singapore to support Singaporeâ€™s plan to transition to electric vehicles nationwide by 2030 (20% of all vehicles to be electric) and 2040 (100% of all vehicles to be electric). This project was funded by the [Science and Technology Policy and Plans Office](https://www.sgdi.gov.sg/ministries/pmo/departments/stppo) as a collaborative effort between IHPC and [TUMCREATE Singapore](https://www.tum-create.edu.sg/). SITEM integrates multiple aspects of mobility and energy modelling to deliver insights on how Singapore could efficiently deploy and manage infrastructure for EV charging. These insights have resulted in significant savings on infrastructure upgrades and allowed public agencies to enhance overall commuter satisfaction.
