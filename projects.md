# 1.  Child and parent perceptions of alternative proteins (2023 - 2025)

As part of a Singapore Food Story Theme 3 grant awarded to my colleague [Dr. Aimee Pink](wwww.researchgate.net/profile/Aimee-Pink), we ran a qualitative study to assess parents and children's perceptions of alternative proteins in Singapore. I conducted focus groups with parents of children between 9 to 15 years of age with the aim of understanding how parents make food-related decisions for their children and their overall attitutes and perceptions towards different kinds of alternative proteins. The overall goal for this study was to engage children at a young age and parents as their primary decision maker for food chocies and empower them as advocates of alternative proteins in order to work towards Singapore's 30 by 30 goal. This study was [pregistered](https://osf.io/ag9n8/).   

We are in the process of analysing data from both parent and child focus groups. Some of our preliminary findings have been presented at conferences like the [British Feeding and Drinking Group Annual Meeting 2023](https://eu.eventscloud.com/website/9856/home/) and [Pangborn Sensory Science Symposium](https://www.pangbornsymposium.com/). 

# 2. Investigating the Influence of the Functional Mechanisms of Digital Health Intervention (DHI) for Dementia Prevention in the Singapore Context

This study is a mixed-methods approach into empirically investigating if and how functional mechanisms of digital health interventions can influence behaviour adoption intentions and health-related self-regulation behaviour among elderly at risk of dementia in Singapore. Through the development of the SENIOR app, we intend to identify indivuals at risk of developing dementia and offer effective behaviour and lifestyle recommendations to mitigate their risk. I lead the behaviour change efforts for this project. The development of the SENIOR app is part of a 2022 Social Sciences and Innovation Seed Fund Grant awarded to Dr. Jason Yue Yanzhen (PI)<sup>1</sup>, <strong>Dr. Nandini Anant</strong><sup>1</sup>, Myo Kyaw Sett<sup>2</sup> and Alok Kumar Verma<sup>2</sup>.


# 3. [Singapore Integrated Transport and Energy Model (SITEM)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-tech-hub/features/uss/integrated-citywide-model-of-vehicle-electrification)

SITEM is the first high-fidelity, island-wide simulation of electric vehicles in Singapore. This project was commissioned by the [Science and Technology Policy and Plans Office](https://www.sgdi.gov.sg/ministries/pmo/departments/stppo) to support Singaporeâ€™s plan to transition to electric vehicles nationwide by 2040. SITEM is a collaborative effort between IHPC and [TUMCREATE Singapore](https://www.tum-create.edu.sg/). We integrate multiple aspects of behaviour modelling, charger placement, mobility and energy modelling to deliver insights on how Singapore can efficiently deploy and manage infrastructure for EV charging. These insights have resulted in significant savings on infrastructure upgrades and allowed public agencies to enhance overall commuter satisfaction. As the Behaviour Team Lead for SITEM, I work closely with the Charger Placement and Mobility Teams to understand how user attitudes, anxieties and behaviours around electric vehicle battery levels can be managed in order to ensure a smooth transition to electric vehicles in Singapore. SITEM has been a hugely successful project with multiple awards, such as the One Public Service Award 2023.

# 4. The Effect of Randomised Rewards in Games: Identifying Specific Features Associated with Problem Gambling Behaviour
This study is an holistic approach to examine motivations and causes that lead individuals to spend money on video games and subsequently develop problem gaming and/or gambling disorders. We are aiming to provide actionable insights by quantifying problematic interpersonal and game design features, identifying similarities in the language used by online gamers and gamblers and measuring the impact of these features on neurobiological markers of addiction in people. This project is funded by a Social Sciences and Innovation Seed Fund Grant awarded to [Dr. Serenella Tolomeo (PI)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K4LqE-UAAAAJ&hl=en), <strong>Dr. Nandini Anant</strong> and [Dr. Prasanta Bhattacharya](https://prasantabhattacharya.github.io/).
